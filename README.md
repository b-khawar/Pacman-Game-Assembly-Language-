# Pacman-Game-Assembly-Language
This project is an implementation of the classic arcade game Pacman, developed using Assembly Language (MASM x86). The game showcases fundamental aspects of assembly language programming while providing a fun and interactive experience.

# Feautures
1. **Memory Setup:** Proper memory allocation for game variables and structures.<br/><br/>
2. **Graphics Initialization:** Setting up the display mode and loading game assets like sprites and maps.<br/><br/>
3. **Main Loop:** A continuous loop that keeps the game running, handling all game events.<br/><br/>
4. **Event Handling:** Responding to user inputs such as keyboard controls for moving Pacman.<br/><br/>
5. **Directional Movement:** Allowing Pacman to move up, down, left, and right.<br/><br/>
6. **Collision Detection:** Preventing Pacman from moving through walls and handling interactions with game elements like dots and ghosts.<br/><br/>
7. **Random Movement:** Simple AI for ghost movement, ensuring they wander around the maze.<br/><br/>
8. **Chase Mechanism:** Ghosts can chase Pacman based on specific conditions to increase game difficulty.<br/><br/>
9. **Score Tracking:** Keeping track of the playerâ€™s score based on collected dots and bonus items.<br/><br/>
10. **Lives Management:** Handling the number of lives, decreasing when Pacman is caught by a ghost.<br/><br/>
11. **Power Pellets:** Introducing power pellets that allow Pacman to eat ghosts temporarily.<br/><br/>
12. **Bonus Items:** Additional items that can be collected for extra points.<br/><br/>
13. **Game Over:** Displaying a game over screen when all lives are lost.<br/><br/>
14. **Victory Condition:** Winning the game by collecting all dots in the maze.<br/><br/>

# How To Run
1. Extract the files from the zip folder.
2. Run the folder using a MASM (x86) compiler i.e.Visual Studio
